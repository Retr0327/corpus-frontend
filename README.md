# Mantine-styled Formik Components in Typescript

This [mantine-next-template](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine-next-template) integrates [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) as a means of form contol. Input components developed by Mantine can be easily controlled through `<FormikController />`.

## The `useSimpleForm` Hook

A custom hook `useSimpleForm` is implemented to solve the problem of boilerplate codes when developers are constructing Formik forms, as shown in `src/pages/index.tsx`. The simple form example is adapted from [Mantine UI](https://ui.mantine.dev/category/authentication#authentication-title), and can be found in `src/pages/simple-form.tsx`.
